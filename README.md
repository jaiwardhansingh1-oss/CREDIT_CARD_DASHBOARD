# CREDIT_CARD_DASHBOARD
Credit Card Project Insights Report

About this Project:
This report looks at credit card data to understand how our business is doing. I checked both the week-by-week changes (WoW) and the overall results for the year (YTD). The aim was to find what’s working well, who our best customers are, and where we can improve.

Main Findings:

Week 53 (31 Dec):

Revenue grew by 28.8% compared to the previous week.

Both transaction amount and the number of transactions went up.

More customers used their cards.

Year to Date:

Total revenue: 57M.

Total interest earned: 8M.

Total transaction amount: 46M.

Male customers brought in more revenue (31M) than female customers (26M).

Blue & Silver credit cards made up 93% of all transactions.

Most transactions came from Texas, New York, and California (68%).

Activation rate: 57.5%.

Delinquency rate (late payments): 6.06%.

Suggestions:

Focus marketing campaigns in Texas, New York, and California.

Try to get the activation rate above 60% with special offers.

Create reward programs for female customers.

Keep a close eye on late payments and take early action.

Tools Used:

Power BI – to make dashboards and visuals.

SQL – to get and summarize the data.

Excel – for cleaning and preparing the data
